GPU computation brings many advances if used for the right thing. Here you find some help on how to do GPU enhanced computations with python

## PyOpenCL
- cl_info.py (get informations about your workstation)
- josephson-junction.py (a physical example)
- pyopencl-non-root-env.pdf (guide to install pyopencl in a non root environment on ubuntu with nvidia devices and evaluation of the josephson-junction example)

## PyCuda
- todo

## Misc
Performance on different GPU devices. See pyopencl-non-root-env.pdf for more info.
